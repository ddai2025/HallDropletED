Full-spectrum exact diagonalization code for electrons in the lowest Landau level in the symmetric gauge.

I developed this code for Ref. [1] and provide detailed derivations in its Supplementary Materials. To the best of my knowledge, the method for explicitly constructing the center-of-mass basis is new.
