# HallDropletED
Full-spectrum exact diagonalization code for a droplet of electrons in the lowest Landau level in the disk geometry.

I developed this code for Ref. [1] and provide detailed derivations in its Supplementary Materials. This code supports arbitrary electron-electron interactions and allows for a variety of observables such as correlation functions to be calculated. To the best of my knowledge, my method for explicitly constructing the center-of-mass basis is new.
